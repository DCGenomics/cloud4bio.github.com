# [Cloud 4 Bio](cloud4bio.github.io) 
C4B meets every Wednesday 9-noon at xxxxx to experiment and keep up with advances in the use of Cloud and Web Computing for Cancer Research. This is a coder's meeting so please bring your laptop and your problems. The data intensive nature of this domain calls for the creation and analysis of BigData that can then be used to contextualize individual observations - the computational essence of Personalized Medicine. The development of [Serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) Web Services and Applications are therefore a major practical focus of this group.

## Learning languages
Being a programmer is not a requirement, but wanting to be one definitely is. If you don't have a programmer habit already it may help to first camp out at [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). You are of course welcome to bring your own experience with other programming environments, particularly those geared towards Data Science and Machine Learning applications such as R, Matlab, Python.

## How to join in
Just show up at NCI Shaddy Grove and introduce yourself. Remote participation will also be available after that.

## Frequency
The space is available weekly, you are welcome whenever you have the time, or a problem.
